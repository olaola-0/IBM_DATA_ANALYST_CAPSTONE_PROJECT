# IBM_DATA_ANALYST_CAPSTONE_PROJECT

Welcome to my IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project! This project is the culmination of my learning journey in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate program on Coursera. In this project, I have applied the skills and knowledge I have gained throughout the program to a real-world business problem.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- **data**: This directory contains the dataset used in this project.

- **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

## Requirements
To run the Jupyter notebooks in this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine, as well as the following libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* plotly

You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:
### pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
