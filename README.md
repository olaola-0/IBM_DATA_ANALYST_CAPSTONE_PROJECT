# IBM_DATA_ANALYST_CAPSTONE_PROJECT

Welcome to my IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project! This project is the culmination of my learning journey in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate program on Coursera. In this project, I have applied the skills and knowledge I have gained throughout the program to a real-world business problem.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and provide insights on customer behavior for an online retailer. The dataset used in this project contains transactional data for a period of one year, including customer demographics, product details, and purchase history.

In this project, I have used various data analysis techniques to explore the dataset, identify trends and patterns, and generate insights that can be used by the retailer to optimize their business operations and increase revenue.
